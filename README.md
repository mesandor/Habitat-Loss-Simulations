# Habitat-Loss-Simulations

# Code and associated data files for the simulations and analyses presented in Sandor et al. (in revision) Extinction of biotic interactions due to habitat loss could accelerate the current biodiversity crisis

# "Scenario 1" is the code used for the area loss simulation for the exponential area loss in an empirical network scenario (scenario 1)
# "Scenario 2" is the code used for the area loss simulation for the exponential area loss in synthetic networks scenario (scenario 2)
# "Scenario 3" is the code used for the area loss simulation for the variable rate of linear area loss in synthetic networks scenario (scenario 3)

# Please note that there are stochastic elements to scenarios 2 and 3 and simply running "Scenario 2" and "Scenario 3" code will not produce identical results to those presented in the paper.

# Data files associated with Scenario 1 code:
# BirdNames.csv
# BirdsGridsJoin.csv.zip: Large file, must be unzipped before using. 
# FullNetworkpresabs.csv
# GridPathForAnalysis.csv
# PlantNames.csv
# PlantsGridsJoin.csv
